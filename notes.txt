pandas	:	It is used for data analysis. It can take multi-dimensional arrays as input and produce charts/graphs. pandas may take a table with columns of different datatypes. It may ingest data from various data files and database like SQL, Excel, CSV etc.

NumPy	:	It provides n-dimensional array object. It also provides mathematical functions which can be used in many calculations.

SciPy	: 	A collection of scientific computing functions. It provides advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, and statistical distributions.
	
matplotlib:	It is a scientific plotting library usually required to visualize data. Importantly visualization is required to analyze the data. You can plot histograms, scatter graphs, lines etc.

scikit-learn:	Itis built on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib provides tools for data analysis and data mining. It provides classification and clustering algorithms built in and some datasets for practice like iris dataset, Boston house prices dataset, diabetes dataset etc.
